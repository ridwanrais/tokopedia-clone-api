### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ridwan Rais!
This is my personal project that I've been working on; a backend API for a Tokopedia (e-commersite site) clone website.

This API implements essential software design for a professional project, including Clean Architecture, Unit Testing, and dependency injection.

I use MongoDB for the database because I've previously used PostgreSQL and MySQL and want to try something new. It's simpler to put it into practice than I anticipated, which surprises me a little bit.
